# PHP 7.0 (and 5.6) on Ubuntu

# PHP 7 is released but for those of us who don't usually compile our own PHP, 
# it can be a long wait for our preferred distro to release the packages we want. 
# For Ubuntu, I'm using a PPA which allows both PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0 to be installed, including things like extensions, at the same time. 
# It was very easy to set up 
# (I'm running Ubuntu 15.10 but this process should also work on older versions back to at least 14.04 which is the previous LTS) 
# so here's a quick walkthrough of what I did.

# Add the PPA to the setup 
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php

# Update the version
sudo apt-get update

# Install New PHP versions
sudo apt-get install php5.6 php7.0

# Update PHP 7 version(for example); do the same for each PHP versions
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install php7.0-mysql
sudo apt autoremove

# Configure and switch version
# To have PHP 7 running:
sudo a2dismod php5.6
sudo a2enmod php7.0
sudo service apache2 restart

# To have PHP 5.6 running:
sudo a2dismod php7.0
sudo a2enmod php5.6
sudo service apache2 restart

# Locate and Edit PHP.INI files for needed changes
sudo vi /etc/php/5.6/apache2/php.ini
sudo vi /etc/php/7.0/apache2/php.ini
